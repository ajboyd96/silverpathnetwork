# Silver Path Network - Google Sheets SMS Verification Setup

This system uses Google Apps Script to manage verification codes from a Google Sheet and send emails when leads request verification.

## 📋 Complete Setup Guide

### Step 1: Prepare Your Google Sheet

1. **Open your Google Sheet:** https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MZYgrMksEKzKksiXYf7B2dNnrzu9prScwbCZ0TWmIxc/edit

2. **Set up Sheet 1 (Verification Codes):**
   - Column A: Row numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.)
   - Column B: 6-digit codes (the 50 codes you generated)
   - Column C: Used status (TRUE/FALSE) - leave blank initially
   - Column D: Timestamp used - leave blank initially

3. **Create Sheet 2 (Lead Info):**
   - Create a new sheet tab named "Lead Info"
   - The script will automatically add headers when first lead is submitted

### Step 2: Set Up Google Apps Script

1. **Open Google Apps Script:**
   - Go to https://script.google.com
   - Click "New Project"

2. **Add the Script Code:**
   - Delete the default code
   - Copy the entire contents of `google-apps-script.js`
   - Paste it into the script editor

3. **Configure the Script:**
   - Find the line: `const SPREADSHEET_ID = '1MZYgrMksEKzKksiXYf7B2dNnrzu9prScwbCZ0TWmIxc';`
   - Verify this matches your Google Sheet ID
   - Update `ADMIN_EMAIL = 'ajboyd96@gmail.com';` if needed

4. **Set Permissions:**
   - Click the lock icon (Permissions)
   - Review and accept permissions for:
     - Google Sheets access
     - Gmail sending
     - Properties service

5. **Deploy as Web App:**
   - Click "Deploy" > "New Deployment"
   - Choose type: "Web app"
   - Description: "Silver Path SMS Verification"
   - Execute as: "Me"
   - Who has access: "Anyone"
   - Click "Deploy"
   - **Copy the deployment URL** - you'll need this!

### Step 3: Update Assessment Form

1. **Edit assessment.html:**
   - Find the line: `const GOOGLE_SCRIPT_URL = 'YOUR_GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL_HERE';`
   - Replace with your actual deployment URL from Step 2

2. **Test the Connection:**
   - Save and deploy your website
   - Try the assessment form to ensure it connects properly

### Step 4: Test the Complete Flow

1. **Test Verification Code Request:**
   - Go to your assessment form
   - Fill out the contact information
   - Click "Send Verification Code"
   - Check ajboyd96@gmail.com for the email with the code

2. **Test Code Verification:**
   - Enter the code from the email
   - Verify it accepts the correct code
   - Check that the lead appears in Sheet 2

3. **Check Sheet Updates:**
   - Verify the code is marked as "used" in Sheet 1
   - Confirm lead data appears in Sheet 2

## 🔧 How It Works

### Email Flow:
1. **Lead fills form** → Triggers Google Apps Script
2. **Script picks unused code** from Sheet 1, marks it as used
3. **Sends email to ajboyd96@gmail.com** with lead info and code
4. **Also sends email to lead** with their verification code
5. **Lead enters code** → Script verifies against stored session
6. **Successful verification** → Lead data saved to Sheet 2

### Email Templates:

**Admin Email (to ajboyd96@gmail.com):**
```
Subject: Silver Path Network - Verification Code for [FirstName]

Hi [FirstName],

Thanks for your submission! Use code [6-digit code] to verify your number with Silver Path Network.

This code expires in 5 minutes.

```

**Lead Email:**
```

This code expires in 5 minutes.
