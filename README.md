## Quick Deployment to Netlify

### Option 1: Drag & Drop (Easiest - 5 minutes)
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) and sign up
2. Look for "Want to deploy a new site without connecting to Git?"
3. Drag the entire `silverpathnetwork` folder into the drop zone
4. Your site will be live with a random URL like `amazing-turtle-123456.netlify.app`

### Option 2: GitHub Integration (Better for updates)
1. Create a GitHub account at [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Create a new repository called "silverpathnetwork"
3. Upload the contents of this folder to the repository
4. In Netlify, click "New site from Git"
5. Connect your GitHub and select the repository
6. Click "Deploy site"

## Adding Your Custom Domain

### In Netlify Dashboard:
1. Click "Domain settings"
2. Click "Add custom domain"
3. Enter: `silverpathnetwork.com`
4. Choose to register through Netlify ($15/year) OR buy elsewhere

### If buying elsewhere (like Namecheap):
